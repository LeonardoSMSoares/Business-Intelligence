    "We have looked at inventory policies that follow specific rules. In other words, we ordered a set amount of inventory at set times. The implication, and actually a requirement for that kind of policy, was that we assumed that demand and costs were fixed. In other words, they were deterministic and unchanging. And of course, that's not how the real world works. \n",
    " \n",
    "So instead, most companies will choose to reorder when inventory reaches a specific level. This policy has a lot of advantages. The first is that it lets you react if demand is higher than expected. And secondly, it allows a chosen risk of running out of stock. We always want to have items on hand for when a customer wants to buy them, but that's not always possible. And the question is how you balance the risks."

    "The policies that we'll take a look use a demand curve that is based on the normal distribution. The normal distribution is centered around a mean. And let's say that we want to have a level of service of 95%. In other words, based on our past demand, we want to be able to meet 95% of all orders and we will create our reorder and inventory policy around that assumption. So what do we need to do? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, to set our policy, we need to **calculate our base stock**. That's the amount of goods that we start with. **Set a reorder point** so that we know when we need to place an order. And this is the economic order quantity from previous Jupyter Notebooks, so we're not doing away with all of that work entirely. We also **specify a risk of stocking out**, 95% or some other value. And of course, our **goal is to meet a target level of service** for our customers. We probably can't avoid losing one or two, but we don't want to lose too many. And that's where the math and our management judgment comes in handy."
