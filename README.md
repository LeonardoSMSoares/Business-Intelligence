# Business-Intelligence
Analytics on various processes to make strategic decisions.


The first four Jupyter Notebooks are based in the course "Excel Supply Chain Analysis Solving Inventory Problems" by Curt Frye in LinkedIn. 
After I had finished the course I thought it would be fun to redo it in Python.

To the fifth to the eighth Jupyter are based in the book "Quantitative Methods for Business". It's a theorical book but I see some possibilities in Python.

To the nineth to twelveth are some exercices that I found interesting in the book "Marketing Data Science" by Thomas W. Miller

Finally, I used this repository as voult to some projects associated with Business Intelligence.
